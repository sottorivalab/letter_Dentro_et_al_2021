# letter_Dentro_et_al_2021

### General content

This repository contains the code used to produce all the analyses and figures in the letter. The code has been organized into articles that can be accessed at the following link ![]. 

Each article provides the explanation for reproducing a particular point in the analysis.


We also release some processed dataset obtained from the anlysis of overdispesion in germline SNPs, in particular:

* `rho_selected_cases.tsv` a text file with the rho values for 41 selected sample
* `samples_letter.rda` which contains the tumour aliquot ids of the 41 sample
* `germline_analysis.rds` an rds file with `BMix` fits and common information criteria scores for each of the 41 sample

```
